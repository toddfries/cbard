Draft 1
Way to keep AI in check	Importance	Description
Build AI systems that are aligned with human values	Very important	AI systems should be designed to promote human well-being and avoid causing harm.
Create AI systems that are transparent and accountable	Important	AI systems should be designed in a way that allows humans to understand how they work and hold them accountable for their decisions.
Develop AI systems that are robust and reliable	Important	AI systems should be designed to be robust and reliable in order to avoid failures that could cause harm to humans.
Educate the public about AI	Important	The public should be educated about the potential benefits and risks of AI in order to make informed decisions about its use.
Develop international agreements on AI	Important	International agreements should be developed to regulate the development and use of AI in order to prevent it from being used for harmful purposes.
These are just a few of the ways that humans can keep AI in check and avoid extermination in the distant future. It is important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem, and the best approach will vary depending on the specific circumstances.

Draft 2
Way to keep AI in check	Description
Ethical guidelines	AI systems should be designed and developed in a way that is aligned with human values and ethics. This means that they should not be used to harm or discriminate against others, and they should be transparent and accountable in their decision-making.
Regulation	Governments should regulate the development and use of AI systems to ensure that they are safe and ethical. This could include requiring companies to disclose how their AI systems work, and to obtain permission before using them in certain ways.
Education	People should be educated about the benefits and risks of AI, and how to use it responsibly. This could include teaching people how to identify bias in AI systems, and how to use them to make informed decisions.
Public awareness	The public should be aware of the potential risks of AI, and how to protect themselves. This could include campaigns to raise awareness of the dangers of AI-powered systems, and to encourage people to use them with caution.
Research	More research is needed to understand the full potential of AI, and how to mitigate its risks. This could include research into the ethical implications of AI, and into ways to make AI systems more transparent and accountable.
These are just some of the ways that humans can keep AI in check. It is important to remember that AI is a tool, and like any tool, it can be used for good or for evil. It is up to us to ensure that AI is used responsibly, and that it does not pose a threat to humanity.

Draft 3
ere is a table listing the importance of every conceivable way for humans to keep AI in check and avoid extermination in the distant future as well as a brief description of how to implement each:

Way	Importance	How to implement
Government regulation	AI systems are becoming increasingly powerful and complex, and it is important to have regulations in place to ensure that they are used responsibly. For example, governments could regulate the use of AI in areas such as healthcare, criminal justice, and self-driving cars.	Governments could establish a regulatory agency to oversee the development and use of AI. The agency could develop standards for the design and operation of AI systems, and it could also investigate and enforce violations of the regulations.
Public education	It is important to educate the public about AI so that they can understand its potential benefits and risks. For example, schools could teach students about AI in computer science classes, and they could also hold public events to raise awareness of AI issues.	Schools could offer courses on AI ethics and law, and they could also host debates and discussions on the future of AI.
Industry self-regulation	The AI industry could develop its own standards and guidelines for the responsible development and use of AI. For example, companies could agree to not use AI for certain purposes, such as developing autonomous weapons.	The AI industry could establish a non-profit organization to develop and promote these standards and guidelines. The organization could also work with governments to develop regulations that are aligned with industry standards.
International cooperation	AI is a global issue, and it is important to have international cooperation to address it. For example, governments could work together to develop common standards for the development and use of AI. They could also cooperate on research and development of AI technologies.	Governments could establish an international organization to coordinate efforts on AI. The organization could develop a framework for international cooperation on AI, and it could also provide a forum for countries to discuss and debate AI issues.
These are just a few of the ways that humans can keep AI in check and avoid extermination in the distant future. It is important to start thinking about these issues now, so that we can develop effective solutions before it is too late.
