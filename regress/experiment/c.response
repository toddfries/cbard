Here is a list of 15 positive science fiction movie concepts that have a chance of becoming reality in the next 100 years, along with the movie title and year of release, and how they will have a positive impact:

The Holodeck (Star Trek: The Next Generation, 1987): The holodeck is a computer-generated simulation that allows users to experience realistic environments and interact with virtual objects. This technology could be used to provide realistic training for astronauts, doctors, and other professionals. It could also be used to create virtual worlds for entertainment and education.
Space Travel (2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968): Space travel is the ability to travel through space to other planets and stars. This technology could allow humans to explore the solar system and beyond. It could also allow us to colonize other planets and create new civilizations.
Artificial Intelligence (The Matrix, 1999): Artificial intelligence is the ability of a machine to mimic human intelligence. This technology could be used to automate many tasks that are currently done by humans. It could also be used to create virtual assistants that can help us with everything from scheduling appointments to planning vacations.
Self-Driving Cars (Back to the Future Part II, 1989): Self-driving cars are cars that can drive themselves without human input. This technology could revolutionize transportation. It could make it safer and more efficient to get around. It could also allow people to live in more remote areas without having to worry about how they will get around.
Holographic Projection (Iron Man, 2008): Holographic projection is a technology that allows images to be projected into the air. This technology could be used to create virtual displays that can be seen by multiple people at once. It could also be used to create holograms that can interact with people.
3D Printing (The Jetsons, 1962): 3D printing is a technology that allows objects to be created by printing them layer by layer. This technology could be used to create custom-made products for people. It could also be used to create parts for machines.
Virtual Reality (The Lawnmower Man, 1992): Virtual reality is a technology that allows users to experience a simulated environment. This technology could be used to create immersive entertainment experiences. It could also be used to train people for dangerous or difficult tasks.
Artificial Organs (Elysium, 2013): Artificial organs are organs that are created by machines. This technology could be used to replace organs that have been damaged or destroyed. It could also be used to create organs that are better than the ones that humans have.
Gene Editing (Gattaca, 1997): Gene editing is a technology that allows genes to be altered. This technology could be used to cure diseases. It could also be used to create designer babies.
Space Elevator (Avatar, 2009): A space elevator is a structure that extends from the surface of the Earth to a point in space. This technology could be used to transport people and cargo between Earth and space. It could also be used to mine resources from asteroids and other planets.
Fusion Energy (The Day the Earth Stood Still, 1951): Fusion energy is a type of energy that is produced by combining atoms. This technology could provide a clean and abundant source of energy. It could also help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Renewable Energy (The Martian, 2015): Renewable energy is energy that comes from sources that are naturally replenished. This technology could help to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. It could also help to reduce pollution.
Water Purification (Waterworld, 1995): Water purification is the process of removing impurities from water. This technology could help to make water safe to drink. It could also help to reduce the amount of water pollution.
Medical Advances (I am Legend, 2007): Medical advances are new treatments and cures that are developed for diseases. This technology could help to cure diseases that are currently incurable. It could also help to improve the quality of life for people who are living with chronic diseases.
Peace (Star Trek, 1966): Peace is the state of being free from war and violence. This technology could help to reduce the number of wars that are fought. It could also help to promote understanding and cooperation between different cultures.
These are just a few of the positive science fiction movie concepts that have a chance of becoming reality in the next 100 years. These technologies could have a profound impact on our lives and on the world around us.
