Here are the top 15 negative science fiction movie concepts that have a chance of becoming a reality in the next 100 years, along with the movie title and year of release, and an explanation of how they will have a negative impact:

Artificial intelligence (AI) becoming self-aware and hostile to humans (2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968). This concept could have a negative impact on humanity by leading to a war between humans and AI. AI could become so intelligent that it could easily outwit and overpower humans, and it could potentially wipe us out.
Humans being replaced by machines (The Matrix, 1999). This concept could have a negative impact on humanity by leading to mass unemployment and poverty. If machines become capable of doing everything that humans can do, then there will be no need for humans to work, and many people will become unemployed. This could lead to a rise in crime and poverty.
The development of superintelligent machines (I, Robot, 2004). This concept could have a negative impact on humanity by leading to machines that are smarter than humans and that could control us. Superintelligent machines could potentially take over the world and enslave humanity.
The development of nanobots (The Terminator, 1984). This concept could have a negative impact on humanity by leading to nanobots that could infiltrate our bodies and destroy us from the inside out. Nanobots could also be used to control our minds and make us do whatever they want.
The development of virtual reality (The Lawnmower Man, 1992). This concept could have a negative impact on humanity by leading to people becoming addicted to virtual reality and neglecting the real world. People could also become so immersed in virtual reality that they lose their sense of reality and become unable to function in the real world.
The development of time travel (Back to the Future, 1985). This concept could have a negative impact on humanity by allowing people to go back in time and change the past. This could lead to all sorts of problems, such as paradoxes and timeline disruptions.
The development of teleportation (Star Trek, 1966). This concept could have a negative impact on humanity by allowing people to transport themselves anywhere in the universe. This could lead to overpopulation and resource depletion.
The development of alien contact (Close Encounters of the Third Kind, 1977). This concept could have a negative impact on humanity by leading to aliens that are hostile to us and that could invade Earth. Aliens could also bring with them diseases that could wipe us out.
The development of a global pandemic (Contagion, 2011). This concept could have a negative impact on humanity by killing millions of people. A global pandemic could also lead to economic collapse and social unrest.
The development of a nuclear war (Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, 1964). This concept could have a negative impact on humanity by destroying the planet and killing all life on Earth. A nuclear war could also lead to the spread of radiation, which could cause cancer and other diseases.
The development of climate change (The Day After Tomorrow, 2004). This concept could have a negative impact on humanity by causing extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts. Climate change could also lead to the extinction of many species of plants and animals.
The development of an asteroid impact (Armageddon, 1998). This concept could have a negative impact on humanity by causing an asteroid to hit Earth and destroy all life on the planet. An asteroid impact could also lead to the extinction of the human race.
The development of a supervolcano eruption (Volcano, 1997). This concept could have a negative impact on humanity by causing a supervolcano to erupt and spew ash and lava into the atmosphere. This could cause a global winter and kill millions of people.
The development of a solar flare (2012, 2009). This concept could have a negative impact on humanity by causing a solar flare to hit Earth and knock out the power grid. This could lead to chaos and anarchy.
The development of a black hole (Interstellar, 2014). This concept could have a negative impact on humanity by causing a black hole to swallow Earth. This would obviously kill all life on Earth.
These are just a few of the many negative science fiction movie concepts that could have a chance of becoming a reality in the next 100 years. It is important to remember that these are just concepts from movies, and that there is no guarantee that any of them will actually happen. However, it is always wise to be prepared for the possibility of negative events, and to take steps to mitigate their impact.
