As IND, the most important items to act on in politics are:

The Second Amendment. The right to bear arms is essential to the defense of liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
The First Amendment. The freedom of speech, religion, and assembly are the foundation of a free society.
The Tenth Amendment. The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.
The Constitution. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land and the foundation of our government.
The Declaration of Independence. The Declaration of Independence is the founding document of our nation and a statement of our principles.
These are the most important items to act on in politics because they are the foundation of our freedom and our way of life.

BARD: These are all important items, but I would also add that it is important to act on issues that are important to the people. For example, many people are concerned about the economy, so it is important to act on policies that will create jobs and improve the standard of living.

IND: The economy is important, but it is not the most important thing. The most important thing is to protect our freedom and our way of life.
